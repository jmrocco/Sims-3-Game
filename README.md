# Sims 3 Video Game


My recreation/version of the Sims 3 Video Game.


#### How to Download & Run


Before you do anything; the project runs on the Visual Studio IDE. If you don't have that installed follow the [link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)


Git clone the repository to your computer.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jmrocco/Sims-3-Game.git
```

To run the game open the `Sims 3 Game.sln` file; it will open in Visual Studio.


In order for the game to work you must build the project first. 


Navigate to the build menu at the top of the screen and click `Build Sims 3`


Once it is finished building you may click start to run the game.


Enjoy! :)
